# lengine

(WIP) Pure Lua  3D Minecraft-Like engine usin moonlibs



# Dependencies

This project uses the [moonLibs](https://github.com/stetre/moonlibs).
Specifically, [moonGL](https://github.com/stetre/moongl), [moonGLFW](https://github.com/stetre/moonglfw), [moonGLMATH](https://github.com/stetre/moonglmath), [moonAssimp](https://github.com/stetre/moonassimp), and [moonImage](https://github.com/stetre/moonimage).

You need Lua 5.3 for those libraries.



# Goals

Use this to implement a minecraft classic client.
I've written and tested the protocol implementation already. All it's missing is a real 3D renderer.

This is the attempt to write a voxel engine to be used in such a game(But not limited to a minecraft classic client; In the future, I want to write other voxel-based games as well).

This is my first real OpenGL project.
